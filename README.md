#### Project description
We are Uncovering the effects of global climate change on the Australian Great Barrier Reef.

Looked at historical trends in Sea Surface Temperature(SST)°C and the economic effects on tourism consumption near the Great Barrier Reef.  

The project imports satellite remote sensing measurement data for Northern GBR and Central GBR and analyzes the effect on increased Sea Surface Temperature (SST) on Coral Bleaching.

Corals experience thermal stress when the SST is 1°C warmer than the highest monthly mean temperature and the bleaching Threshold is 1° C more than max average month temperature.

We needed some way to measure not only how far the temperature is above the threshold, but how long it has stayed above that point, also known as the Degree Heating Weeks(DHW). The DHW shows how much heat stress has accumulated in an area over the past 12 weeks (3 months).

Wanted to see if these changes in SST connected with a decrease in tourism consumption in North Tropical Queensland, Australia due to coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef.
